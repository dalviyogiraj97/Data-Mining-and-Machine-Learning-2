This section discusses a relevant transfer learning approach to detect driver drowsiness. In recent years, there is an increase in the number of road accidents which are caused due to driver fatigue. According to a survey conducted by National Safety Council (NSC), 15% of accidents per year occur due to driver drowsiness which is around 1600 deaths and 71000 injuries occur due to driver drowsiness. There are various factors causing driver drowsiness which of them are dizziness caused due to intake of certain medication, job stress and sleep disorder which results in lack of focus, the low judgement of vehicles speed and slow reaction time. Hence it becomes essential to develop a system that effectively helps in detecting driver’s drowsiness which will reduce road crashes saving millions of lives. Facial actions such as yawn, and closed eyes were used to detect the state of the driver and all these measures are passed to the transfer learning model to detect the driver’s drowsiness. Four models of transfer learning genre were implemented on a small-scale dataset. The VGG16 outperformed InceptionV3, ResNet-50 and Xception models and achieved 93% accuracy with a balanced classification score.
